Testing the MicroPython PWM facility for the RPi Pico2
------------------------------------------------------

pwm_test.py
A LED is driven by a PWM output pin. The frequency is low enough
to be percived as fast blinking. The on time is varied from full
(glitch-free continuous high) via 2 steps to zero (glitch free low).

servo.py
A python class for an R/C servo driven with a PWM signal.
The pulse repetition frequency defaults to 50 Hz, the pulse length
to 1.0-2.0 ms. The PWM interval is mapped to a either
a (-1.0, 1.0) default centered=True or [0.0, 1.0) centered=False range.

servo_tester.py
Demonstrator for Servo class.
An RC Servo on GPIO16 is driven from the center to one end and back,
a second later to the other end and back, repeating continuously.
