hookup of SD card
-----------------
Vcc - 3.3V
GND - GND
SCLK - SPI0 SCK (GPIO 18)
MOSI - SPI0 TX (GPIO 19)
MISO - SPI0 RX (GPIO 16)
SS - SPI0 CS (GPIO 17)

The program vfs_littlefs_test.py runs on a Raspberry Pico2
and creates 2 files under LittleFS on a connected SD card.

The card can be read under Linux in the following way:
1) installation
sudo apt-get install libfuse-dev
cd ~/Programming
git clone https://github.com/littlefs-project/littlefs-fuse.git
cd littlefs-fuse
make
2) mount a card
mkdir mount
sudo ./lfs /dev/mmcblk0 mount
# now the card content is visible under mount/
sudo umount mount

!!! The SD card can be mounted and read, but after that the
SDcard library on the Pico2 cannot access it anymore !!!
    OSError: [SDCard] readblocks() CMD(17) responds 5
It can be re-formatted on the Pico2 without problems.
Only the first try fails on the Pico2, on a second attempt the card works.
Also files written from the PC are then readable.
